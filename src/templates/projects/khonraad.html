<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    As Head of Innovation and later Lead Emerging Technologies and AI Architect (2019-2025), I led the innovation initiatives for the Netherlands' WvGGZ, WZD and WTH law compliance platform. 
    My role combined maintaining the core platform's architecture while driving innovation projects and ensuring technical excellence across all development activities. 
    I served as second lead during the successful acquisition by Visma in 2020, and represented Khonraad in the expert group ("expertgroep") for the Wvggz-keten organization, where I helped address critical issues in the national care authorization process.
    The value proposition of Khonraad is that it allows all stakeholders to sleep well at night, because they know they are protecting the patients rights and are in compliance with the laws.
