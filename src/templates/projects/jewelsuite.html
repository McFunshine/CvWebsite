<p>
    JewelSuite stands at the forefront of subsurface modeling technology, enabling multidisciplinary teams to analyze and create virtual models of the subsurface environment. This powerful platform allows teams to evaluate different development options, predict profitability, and assess risks in high-stakes energy projects. Developed as a joint venture between Shell and Baker Hughes, this software plays a crucial role in ensuring safe and responsible energy production.

<h2>My Journey & Impact</h2>

<h3>SDK Development & Technical Leadership (2014-2015)</h3>
<p>
    As a Senior .NET Developer, I was instrumental in developing the SDK and API that would become the foundation of the JewelSuite platform. Beyond coding, I served on committees focused on code quality and unit testing, helping establish robust development practices that would scale with the platform's growth.
