<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In 2023-2024, I led the development of a privacy-focused mobile application for mental healthcare professionals to register forced care interventions under the Dutch Mental Healthcare Act (Wvggz). This Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) solution streamlines the administrative burden for healthcare professionals while maintaining strict patient privacy and data security standards.

<h2>Technical Achievements</h2>

<h3>Cross-Platform Development & Architecture</h3>
<p>
    As Lead Developer, I designed and implemented a comprehensive security-first solution:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Designed and implemented a comprehensive Kotlin Multiplatform application delivering seamless experiences across both iOS and Android platforms</li>
    <li>Created an innovative authentication system with multi-factor security (biometrics, PIN, and 2FA) to ensure only authorized personnel can access patient data</li>
    <li>Developed secure token validation and API key management systems with encryption measures that comply with healthcare privacy requirements</li>
    <li>Built a clean architecture with separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data layers for improved maintainability and security</li>
    <li>Implemented advanced encryption for sensitive patient data storage and transmission</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced AI Integration & Privacy Protection</h3>
<p>
    I developed innovative AI solutions that prioritize privacy:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Engineered a novel patient avatar generation system that preserves recognition capability while maintaining anonymity</li>
    <li>Created a prediction model to anticipate the most likely patients and care types to be registered, reducing administrative time</li>
    <li>Developed a speech-to-text transcription system with domain-specific terminology recognition for fast care documentation</li>
    <li>Implemented natural language processing for smart note formatting and validation of required documentation fields</li>
    <li>Built bias detection methods to ensure fair and accurate patient care predictions across diverse populations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Secure API Integration & Patient Management</h3>
<p>
    Security and efficiency were paramount in the API design:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Designed and implemented a complete RESTful API infrastructure for secure communication with the central portal</li>
    <li>Created intelligent patient filtering and search capabilities with intuitive UI for quick identification</li>
    <li>Implemented real-time care suggestion functionality based on historical data and current patient status</li>
    <li>Built robust care registration workflows with appropriate validation for both approved and disallowed care scenarios</li>
    <li>Developed secure offline functionality with encrypted local storage and synchronization when connectivity is restored</li>
</ul>
